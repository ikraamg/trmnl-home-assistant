/**
 * Scheduler Services Manifest
 *
 * Central index of scheduler capabilities.
 * Documents what the scheduler can do at a glance.

 * Following Structural Documentation pattern:
 * - Single entry point for all scheduler operations
 * - Names describe what they do (not how)
 * - All services are stateless functions
